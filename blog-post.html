        <h2>How to create a Google Ads Campaign</h2>
        <h6> January 3, 2020 by Neil Patel</h6>
        <p>Launching a new AdWords search campaign is an exhilarating process. Excitement, anxiety, fear, and hope are emotions that come to mind when I’m about to click the Enable button on a new campaign.</p>
        <h2>Don't Panic!</h2>
        <p>If you’re just starting your journey, then fear may be dominating your thoughts, so in this article, my goal is to put you at ease. The steps I’m about to go through will ensure you’re depositing more money into your own bank account, rather than just funding Google’s empire.</p>
        <h4>My experience</h4>
        <p>I’ll never forget my very first Google AdWords campaign back in 2006. I was fresh out of college and my boss handed me the reins to an account he had set up himself but didn’t have time to manage. My task seemed simple enough. Don’t screw up what was working already, and more importantly, create even more profitable campaigns.</p>
        <p>The three more important aspects of google ads are: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Keywords</li>
          <li>Ads</li>
          <li>Ad groups</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other important aspects are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ad sets</li>
          <li>Audiences</li>
          <li>Creative formats</li>
        </ul>
